				<p>Unemployment is one of the United States' most prevalent issues and has had a major impact on the American population during the most recent years. With the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment numbers have been at an all time high, reaching values that total unemployment rates at around 15%, achieving an 11% increase between March and April of 2020. These values are of extreme importance as they highlight the economic and financial situation of the country. Due to the pandemic, many people became unemployed as companies were not generating enough income to maintain all of their employees. With this, many Americans had to deal with a sudden change in standard of living, as they faced great amounts of uncertainty in relation to the pandemic. In addition, it is clear from the first graph, that as unemployment rates skyrocketed in April of 2020, many were taken by surprise, since numbers maintained a steady pattern in the months before. Therefore, as it reaches an 11% increase, the amount of people affected by unemployment practically quadrupled, leaving many to wonder when companies would stabilize enough to remploy their workers. It is important to consider that in the beginning of the pandemic, governments were faced with such uncertainties that they didn't know how to properly deal with their economies. Therefore, the large increase in unemployment in April of 2020 is also a result of rapid government decisions to close off the country's economy for a period of time as a way to control the spread of the virus on an international scale.</p>
				
				<p>Overall, it is vital to study and understand unemployment data as it signals how well the economy is functioning. As it is explained by Lumen, "Unemployment means we are not using our labor efficiently, so we are not producing the maximum goods and services we could." Therefore, unemployment rates explain how good or bad jobs are being distributed around the country, and based on that, how much more or less the country is producing, and profiting, based on the amount of work that is being done. Also, unemployment refers to one's lack of a monthly income. Therefore, when considering the amount of people that were unemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note that these people were left without a monthly income which put them in great risk during a time of such danger healthwise. Therefore, these people, if they eventually got sick and were in need of treatment, would be left with limited options as to how to act financially. Furthermore, the United States, being the incredibly large and industrialized country that it is, has a labor force that consists of around 160 million workers. In addition to this, around 130,000 more people enter the labor force each month, which requires the economy to generate enough jobs for these people to be successfully employed. During most months, the economy is able to keep up with the amount of workers and those searching for jobs. However, in times where the economy is impaired due to external factors, a large amount of workers are left unemployed, simply because of the absurd number of workers who attempt to join the labor force each month.</p>
				<p>It is possible to also see from the first graph that there was an increase in unemployment rates around the years of 2009-2010. In October 2009, unemployment rates peaked at 10%, which were considered incredibly high numbers at the time. This peak in unemployment was due to the Great Recession which rose in 2008 and unfolded throughout the years of 2009-2010. According to Forbes Magazine, nearly 8 million jobs were lost due to the Great Recession, which resulted in over double the unemployment then what was in place previously. Also, it is possible to interpret from the first graph that it took a while for the economy to recover and stabilize since unemployment rates remained at 10% from June 2009 all the way through May 2010. These values are incredibly significant as they highlight an important moment in history with the collapse of the housing market. The great recession was considered the second-worst economic crisis in US history, according to Business Insider, which explained that the historical disaster was a result of the subprime mortgage market, high risk housing loans and an overload in the worldwide banking system.</p>

				<p>Megan Dunn, Senior Economist at the Division of Labor Force Statistics, provided me with further information which allowed for a deeper analysis of the data I gathered from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. First of all, she provided me with a document titled "The labor market in 2009: recession drags on", which is a monthly labor review constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The document explains that during the great recession, "the number of people who were unemployed because they had lost their jobs rose by 3.7 million in 2009, to 10.0 million." Dunn also provided me with a monthly labor review titled "Unemployment rises in 2020, as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic," which focused primarily on the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates as it discusses "labor market developments during the beginning of the pandemic, including the disproportionate effect on women in the early stages."</p>
				<p>When looking closer at the data values, it is also clear to see a difference in unemployment rates between men and women over the ages of 20 years old. As portrayed on the second graph, values for female and male unemployment during the great recession are completely different as the historical event led to unemployment rates of 10% for males and 8% for females. This is because out of the approximate 160 million Americans who are a part of the workforce, many of the ones who work in more highly populated and less selective jobs which include manufacturing and construction jobs, are males. Therefore, during a period of economic instability like the great recession, jobs like the ones most frequently occupied by men were the ones that had to let the greater quantities of people go.</p>
				<p>However, when analyzing the second graph and focusing specifically on the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to see that unemployment values showcase the exact opposite from what happened during the great recession. As seen on the graph, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment values for women exceeded those for men at around 13% and 16% respectively. This is because many working women heavily depended on the childcare system in order to maintain their nine-to-five jobs. When the pandemic exploded and everyone was forced to stay home it became especially difficult for women, primarily those who are mothers, to both work and actively take care of their children. According to Brookings, "evidence shows working mothers have taken on more of the resulting childcare responsibilities, and are more frequently reducing their hours or leaving their jobs entirely in response [to the pandemic]." Based off this, it is possible to understand that while the pandemic had an impact on male unemployment, women were more strongly affected as they were forced to take on responsibilities that they previously used to delegate.</p>
